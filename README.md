# Final-Game
A summary of the project goals:
  The goal of this project was to create a text-based, choose-your-own-adventure game with audio known as Stranded in the Jungle! The game allows players to navigate through obstacles like building shelters and wild animals. Players face challenging decisions that can lead to multiple outcomes. 

Instructions the player may need: 
  Objective:
    Survive the jungle by making the right choices. Avoid dangers and navigate toward safety.
  Gameplay Flow:
    Start Game
    Make Decisions: Choose from options presented in text to navigate the jungle.
    Health and Timer: Monitor your health and score.
    Endings: The game ends when you are rescued or run out of health.
  Controls:
    Input your choice by typing the corresponding number or letter and pressing Enter.

A list of technologies and techniques you used:
  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries:
    time for delays and timer functionality.
    pygame for gaming functionality
  Game Design Techniques:
    Branching decision trees for choices.
    Health, points, and timer mechanics for gameplay balance.

Citations for any external resources you used:
  Game Design Inspiration:
    Lab for Text Adventure Game.
  Coding:
    Samples provided in Modules and from my original Text Adventure Game.
  Sound Effects and Background:
    Supplied through the resources given through Modules/Canvas. Such as opengameart and openartgame audio. 

A description of your process:
  All elements originated from the GDD and were implimented or adjusted as needed. 

What did you learn?
  The importance of structuring decision trees for clear, logical progression.
  How to use Python libraries (time) to create dynamic and interactive elements.

Where did you get stuck?
  Timer Mechanic: Implementing a countdown while allowing simultaneous input was challenging.
  Branching Complexity: Ensuring choices did not loop endlessly or result in unreachable states.

What would you like to improve?
  Add more dynamic branching and replayability with randomized events or alternate paths.
  Implement better feedback to the player about the outcomes of their choices (like visual representations).

How would you do things differently next time?
  Start with a smaller branching structure and test early, then expand gradually.
  Incorporate automated testing for validating decision paths to catch bugs earlier.
  Focus more on user experience by polishing the narrative and improving instructions.

How far did you stray from the game design document?
  Changes Made: Simplified the number of branching nodes to fit the project timeline. Reduced scope for sound and sprite elements since this was a text-based project.
  What Stayed Consistent: The game’s core mechanics—timers, health, and survival decisions—remained aligned with the original design document.

How did you stay on track?
  Regularly revisiting the game design document to ensure all essential elements were implemented.
  Breaking tasks into weekly milestones as outlined in the GDD.
